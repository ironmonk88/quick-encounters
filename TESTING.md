### Hide/Show and ShowAuto setting
1. ShowAuto = Yes:
1.1 New QE should show QE first and second time								
1.2 Hide QE; now should not show until you click Show again and then should show always				
2. ShowAuto=No
2.1 Existing QE should not show QE unless you use Show button							
2.2 Linked or Created QE should force show the first time

### BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
- Create a QE in v0.5 and make sure it mostly works in 0.6.8
- Pre 0.6.13 (for originalNote): Copy a pre-0.6.13 Note and confirm token placement (with/without saved)
## OLDER TESTING (only on major release)
## BUG FIXES
1. Create 10 saved tokens - check that QE positions saved tokens correctly                                  OK in 0.8.3
2. Reduce 10 to 5 - check that QE positions saved tokens correctly                                          OK in 0.8.3
3. Increase 5 back to 10 - extra 5 tokens should be generated next to Map Note                              OK in 0.8.3
### TUTORIAL
1. Press Quick Encounter button with nothing selected -> should pop up Tutorial					 			OK in 0.8.6
2. With Tutorial open, repeat #1 -> should keep existing Tutorial         						        	OK in 0.8.6
3. Close Tutorial -> should delete the Journal Entry                          						        OK in 0.8.6
4. Open some Journal Entries with no embedded Actors, press QE button -> should open Tutorial               OK in 0.8.6
5. Open multiple Journal Entries with embedded Actors, press QE button -> should run the Encounter          OK in 0.8.6
6. Leave Tutorial Window open; create another Journal Entry, Save, and then close - should be kept		    NOT TESTED	
    - was being deleted in 0.5.2 because it was finding the Tutorial Window

### TEST WITH Foundry 0.7.9
May need to test for version:
- Test CONST.TOKEN_DISPOSITIONS

### USE OLD EMBEDDED METHOD - DEPRECATED
Verify above tests with Use Companion Dialog = TRUE and Use Companion Dialog = FALSE
1. Check that previously created encounters work with new Setting = TRUE
2. Check that previously created encounters work with new Setting = FALSE
3. Create a new Encounter with the "Use new Companion Dialog" = FALSE
